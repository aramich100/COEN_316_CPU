## COEN 316 - Computer Architecture & Design



### Experiment Description :

* Implementation of a __RISC__(_Reduced Instruction Set Computer_) CPU based upon the MIPS processor capable of executing 20 instructions.    
* Different synthesizable VHDL styles(such as structural with port maps, processes and CSA statements) were used to design the processor and were verified by simulation and implementation on the `Xilinx XUPV2Pro FPGA board`.
