# COEN_316_CPU
Implementation of a RISC (Reduced Instruction Set Computer) CPU based upon the MIPS processor capable of executing 20 instructions. Different synthesizable VHDL styles (such as, structural with port maps, processes and CSA statements) were used to design the processor and were verified by simulation and implementation on the Xilinx XUPV2Pro FPGA board.
